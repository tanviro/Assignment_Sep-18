# Calculator Program


## Description
-----------

This is a simple calculator program written in Python that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation.

## Usage
-----

To use the calculator, simply run the `calculator()` function. The program will prompt the user to select an operation and enter two numbers. The result of the operation will be displayed on the screen.

## Operations
------------

* **Add**: Adds two numbers together.
* **Subtract**: Subtracts the second number from the first number.
* **Multiply**: Multiplies two numbers together.
* **Divide**: Divides the first number by the second number. Note that division by zero is not allowed and will result in an error message.
* **Modulus**: Calculates the remainder of dividing the first number by the second number.
* **Power**: Raises the first number to the power of the second number.

## Code Structure
----------------

The code is organized into several functions, each of which performs a specific operation. The `calculator()` function is the main entry point of the program and is responsible for prompting the user for input and calling the appropriate operation function.
